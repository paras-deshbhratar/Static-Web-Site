	<p>With the emergence of new learning formats that promise to the change the face of IT training forever, classroom training needs to evolve in order to stay relevant in a competitive and dynamic ecosystem.</p>

<p>
Harnessing the evergreen potential of classroom training requires training providers to amplify learning outcomes by sharpening the edge of a face-to-face interaction – which is exactly where we step in and make the learning count.
</p>
<p>
As passionate visionaries and problem solvers, we’re driven by our motivation to leverage the unique ability of classroom training to create a great space for constructive dialogue between the trainer and the trainee – that allows participants to gain guidance in a timely manner, learn how to solve complex on-the-job problems, understand the tips of the trade and join an ever-expanding, lifelong collaborative network of fellow participants.
