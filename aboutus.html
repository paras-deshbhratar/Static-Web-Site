        <h3>What we do?<h3>

<p>We are an organisation that delivers and nurtures solutions to people-specific problems.</p>

<p>From our humble beginnings at a Bangalore headquarters in 2001, we have travelled the perennial long distance – becoming India’s fastest growing HR company, and our journey has only just begun.</p>

<p>With an unwavering commitment to world-class customer service, innovative solutions in recruitment & staff outsourcing – we know that every hiring decision we take has business-defining significance.<p>

<p>Setting the highest standards via a rigorous, chiseled recruitment process, we believe that quality and recruitment are two sides of the same coin and one is incomplete without the other. In other words, our recruitment process ensures that all our clients are matched with the best fit candidates across positions.</p>

 

<h3>How we do it?</h3>
        <p>As a results-driven, future-ready company, Alchemy realizes that the previously acceptable idea of aptitude + attitude no longer makes the cut in terms of the utility and suitability of a candidate. Therefore, we integrate the following principles as part of our core offerings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stability</li>
            <li>Flexibility</li>
            <li>Dynamic Agility</li>
            <li>Commitment to Organizational Fit</li>
            <li>Marrying Innovation with Excellence</li>
            <li>Quality and Continuous Process Improvement</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In an industry where change is faster than the speed of thought and unpredictability is the only norm, the only way forward is to execute a tailored recruitment process based on industry-driven requirements. This is where we step in – enabling our clients to transcend their HR goals through measurable results that guarantee all-round satisfaction for all stakeholders.</p>
